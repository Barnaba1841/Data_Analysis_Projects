Solution :
Collection of Data from Espn website in Json file format using web scraping

Data cleaning with python using pandas library

(sometimes taken the help from chat GPT to write syntax for some operations )

And after cleaning the json files export them into csv files which contains different tables in excel format<br>
Transform that data according to your requirements using Power Query

-->The process includes Data Cleaning and Data Modelling Using Dax<br>
we need to establish relationship with different tables using Star Schema.<br>
Using DAX Formulas we create measures for our requirements<br>
