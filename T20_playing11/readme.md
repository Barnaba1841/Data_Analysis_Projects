Solution :
Collection of Data from Espn website in Json file format using web scraping

Data cleaning with python using pandas library

(sometimes taken the help from chat GPT to write syntax for some operations )

And after cleaning the json files export them into csv files


The data Contains various tables <br>
Transform that data according to your requirements using Power Query

-->Next process is Data Cleaning and Data Modelling Using Dax<br>
we need to establish relationship with different tables using Star Schema.<br>
Using DAX Formulas we create measures for our requirements<br>


3)dashboarding and insights generation
Create new measures for key metrics
Build dashboard and select best playing 11
