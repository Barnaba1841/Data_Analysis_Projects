## Predictions for 2024 IPL
- Best all-rounders
- Best playing XI
- Top 4 teams
- Winner & Runner of the 2024 IPL

## Methodology

The methodology for this project was systematic and data-driven, involving several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Initial raw data was processed using Excel. This step involved removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Relationships**: Establishing relationships between different data sets was crucial. This involved linking batsmen stats with player details, bowler stats with match summaries, and so on, to create a holistic view of the data.

3. **Data Modeling**: Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I created complex data models that allowed for advanced calculations and the creation of key measures that would drive the insights.

4. **Dashboard Creation**: With Power BI, I transformed the modeled data into interactive dashboards. These dashboards provided a user-friendly interface to explore the data and uncover trends and patterns.

5. **Content Writing and Design**: Microsoft Copilot assisted in writing content for the project, ensuring clarity and coherence. Canva was used to design the demo magazine, giving it a professional and polished look.

6. **Predictive Analysis**: The final step involved using the established data models to make predictions for the 2024 IPL season, identifying potential top performers and outcomes.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Copilot**: Utilized for content writing, generating DAX formulas, and providing assistance during the data analysis process.
- **Power BI**: Employed to create comprehensive dashboards that visualize the insights derived from the IPL data.
- **Excel**: The primary tool for data cleaning and performing operations on tables to prepare the data for further analysis.
- **Canva**: Used for designing engaging presentations and the layout of the demo magazine, enhancing the visual appeal of the project deliverables.


## Demo Magazine
As part of this project, I created a 6-page demo magazine for a sports magazine, showcasing the insights and predictions made through the analysis.
